            <li>0.25 cup julienned sun-dried tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
                Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until penne start to get tender, about 8 minutes.<br>
                Drain and reserve 0.25 cup pasta water.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, cook Italian sausage in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until brown and crumbly, about 5 minutes.<br>
                Transfer to a paper towel lined plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saut√© minced garlic and red pepper flakes until garlic is fragrant, 30 to 45 seconds.<br>
                Sprinkle flour over mixture and stir to combine, making sure there are no lumps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in milk, cream, and reserved pasta water.<br>
                Mix mozzarella, provolone, Fontina, and Parmesan cheeses in a bowl and stir in about 4/5th of the cheese mixture. Stir to combine.<br>
                Add penne, cooked Italian sausage, and julienned sun casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining cheese mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.
