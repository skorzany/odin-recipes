# odin-recipes

This is my take on 'Project: Recipes', from The Odin Project Foundations course.

A basic HTML website containing different cooking recipes.
The main purpose of this project is to play around with HTML fundamentals 
as well as getting used to git workflow and commit messages best practices.

Some of the skills practiced here:
*basic html tags and attributes,
*images,
*relative and absolute links,
*ordered and unordered lists,
*git commits and deployment.

Please note that the recipes provided are picked randomly and do not represent my personal taste.
